## Security Considerations

This application is designed for educational and professional reference purposes. While we strive for accuracy in calculations:

1. **Professional Verification Required**: All calculations should be independently verified by qualified engineers
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Users must ensure compliance with applicable safety standards and regulations
3. **No Warranty**: This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind
4. **Liability Disclaimer**: Users assume all responsibility for the use of calculation results

## Data Privacy

This application:
- Runs entirely in the browser (client-side)
- Does not transmit calculation data to external servers
- Uses local storage only for saving user configurations
- Does not collect personal information
