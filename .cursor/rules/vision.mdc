description: Technical vision and architectural principles for the gunsmith barrel calculator

# Technical Vision

## **Core Philosophy**
Build a **precision engineering tool** disguised as a simple web app - where complex thick-walled cylinder analysis becomes as accessible as a pocket calculator, yet maintains the rigor expected by professional engineers.

## **Architectural Principles**

### **Client-First Architecture**
- **Zero server dependency** - Everything runs in the browser
- **Offline-capable** - Works without internet after initial load  
- **Static deployment** - GitHub Pages compatible
- **Progressive enhancement** - Graceful degradation across devices

### **Modular Engineering**
- **Pure ES6 modules** with explicit imports/exports
- **Domain separation** - Units, calculations, UI, and data as distinct modules
- **Event-driven coupling** - Components communicate via CustomEvents
- **Testable units** - Each module independently verifiable

### **Precision-First Design**
- **SI canonical storage** - All internal calculations in metric base units
- **Boundary conversions** - Unit conversion only at UI interfaces
- **Tolerance awareness** - 1e-9 relative precision for engineering accuracy
- **No precision drift** - Round-trip conversions preserve original values

### **Professional UX Standards**
- **Mobile-first responsive** - Bootstrap 5.3 with semantic HTML
- **WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility** - Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Real-time validation** - Immediate feedback without form submission
- **Progressive disclosure** - Advanced features hidden until needed

## **Implementation Strategy**
Focus on **engineering correctness over feature completeness** - each module must be mathematically sound and thoroughly tested before moving to the next layer of functionality.
